{"name":"DocMan","body":"## DocMan\r\nDocMan is a collaborative document management software, powered by [Django](http://djangoproject.org). \r\n\r\nThis software has been written to create a space for easy document management and sharing. You are able to create categories and assign them to a specific (or none) semester. Within this categories, there can be lectures or pseudo lectures where documents can be uploaded to. Documents can be commented, rated, tagged and of course be downloaded in original file format or zipped. You can follow a lecture or document and get notified if something changes. Also, a kind of revision management for each document. DocMan has a powerful rights management system.\r\n\r\nRead more about DocMan on [get.docman.me](http://get.docman.me).\r\n\r\n*Please note: This is the open source version of DocMan which is missing some features offered on [get.docman.me](http://get.docman.me).*\r\n\r\n### Learn more about our SaaS solution\r\nInterested in using DocMan but no idea what to do?

[Read more](http://get.docman.me)\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nDocMan requires several modules to be installed:\r\n\r\n* [python-django](http://djangoproject.org) -- at least Django 1.3\r\n* [mysql-python](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/) when using MySQL database backend\r\n* [python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil)\r\n* [django-registration](http://code.google.com/p/django-registration/)\r\n* [whoosh](https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/wiki/Home)\r\n* [django-ratings](https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings)\r\n* [django-tagging](http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/)\r\n* [pyPdf](http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/)\r\n* [django-haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/)\r\n* [py-bcrypt](http://code.playfire.com/django-bcrypt//)\r\n* [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)\r\n* [django-facebook](https://github.com/tschellenbach/Django-facebook)\r\n\r\nAlso, your webserver needs needs to know about [X-SENDFILE](https://tn123.org/mod_xsendfile/).\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nFirst, copy `settings_local.py-dist` to `settings_local.py` and edit the file to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nThen, it is just a regular django application setup: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./manage.py syncdb\r\n$ ./manage.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you should be done with your testing environment.\r\n\r\n### Rebuild full text search index\r\nTo rebuild your search index, please run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python manage.py rebuild_index --noinput 2>&1 >/dev/null &\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best idea is to run this via crond to rebuild the index once or twice per hour.\r\n\r\n###Contribute to the translation\r\nIf you want to contribute to the translation, you can improve the current translations\r\nor start a new translation into a different language. To do so, you need xgettext/gettext\r\nwhich you can install using e.g. `sudo apt-get install gettext` on Ubuntu/Debian systems.\r\nThen go to the DocMan folder and create/update the .po file for you language.\r\nFor German (`de`) the command would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd docman\r\n$ django-admin.py makemessages -l de\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you're done translating the strings in the file *locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po*,\r\nrun \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ django-admin.py compilemessages\r\n```\r\n\r\nand test if everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n###Icon copyright\r\nIcons powered by iconfinder.com, most of them free for commercial use.","tagline":"Collaborative Document Management written in Python (Django) - Open Source","google":"UA-28220405-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
